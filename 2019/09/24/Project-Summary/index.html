<p>The applications of machine learning expand beyond our general assumptions. From database mining, web search engine, to spam detector, the ever-improving technology of machine learning benefits companies and organizations across the globe. One may consider this technology to be hard to grasp and complex, yet it is straightforward and can also be simply explained with linear regression models. Using python, we want to test machine learning’s ability to make accurate predictions on the world ranking of 196 players on the professional golf tour using performance-based data. </p>
<p>For this project, we are using the 70 data ranging from players’ ages, driving distances, fairway hits, total stroke gained, to green in regulations from the year of 2017. The preliminary process of this project is constructing histograms for each row of data to obtain general information such as patterns and outliers using the plotting library Matplotlib in python.  </p>
<center>June 23rd,2019 </center>

<p>Today we talked about the definition of machine learning by Tom Mitchell. Using linear regression as a suitable example to explain the definition, I learned how process of machine learning is simplified to “T”, “E” and “P”. “T” as in tasks, “E” as in experiences, and “P” as in Performance. In linear regression, the line of best fit is determined by the data or inputs on the graph, and an equation is used in this process of determination.  To explain linear regression using the definition of machine learning, the task of the model is to provide an estimate value, and the model’s performance improve as it experiences more data.</p>
<p>In machine learning, terms like training dataset and learning dataset are used. Training dataset are used to train a prediction model and the model is then applied to the test dataset. One error involved in the making of prediction models is overfitting. Overfitting describes a situation where the model fits the training dataset too well but applies poorly in the test dataset. The model may be too complex for the dataset given or the training dataset is too limited to be applied to the test dataset. </p>
<p>One of the ways to measure the performance of a regression model is by mean squared error(MSE). The equation of </p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/1.png" alt="3.jpg"></p>
<p>is used, where equals the number of observation, y’ is the actual value and y is the prediction. The value of the equation 0 equals a perfect model, and the value increases aa the prediction diverges. However the value of MSE can often be too large to measure the performance clearly and the square root of MSE is used (RMSE) Is used. Another way of evaluating linear regression is using R squared(Coefficient of determination). The equation of</p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/2.png" alt="3.jpg"></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/3.png" alt="3.jpg"></p>
<p>is used for this method of evaluation and the value is given between 1 to 0. And when the value equals to 1, the prediction model is perfect. </p>

<p>Today, we discussed data visualization. The uses of bar graph and for-loops are effective ways to quickly visualize a large quantity of data to find the outliers or patterns. There are several ways to organize and clean the raw data into easily understandable format. Examples of that is finding the missing data using .isnull() and converting the data with thousandth separator into integers using the thousands=’,’. Another way to better understand the data is through the use of encoding. One example of that is the one-hot encoding that converts categorical values into integer values that consists of 0s and 1s. The use of encoding allows us to effectively compare data that consist of categorical information. </p>
<p>Pearson correlation is also another topic we discussed. When comparing two numerical data, a Pearson correlation coefficient is a number between 1 and -1 that how the two variables are linearly related. For categorical and numerical data, mean and medians are used to measure their correlation. For two categorical data however, information gain is used. The term entropy was also introduced. The definition of entropy in information is the measure of randomness, disorder or uncertainty in data. The equation for entropy is: </p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/4.png" alt="3.jpg"></p>
<p>Entropy in a way defines how a decision tree splits its data, and we can also utilize python to  calculate entropy. The decision tree is a tree like structure that maps out the model of decisions and their possible consequences. The information gain is also used in the construction of the decision tree, and the algorism will always maximize the information gain. The equation for information gain is:</p>

<p>Today, we discussed the different types of machine learning problems. The problems have two major types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised ML problems, all data are labelled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input. On the other hand, unsupervised problems have only input but no label and no corresponding output (no right answers). Under the branch of unsupervised problems, cluster is a type that allows you to get insights of the data through organizing and splitting. Under the supervised branch are classification and regression. Classification involves categorical data whereas regression involves numerical data. Under the regression type are multivariable and single variable. Then we further discussed about the decision tree. The training process builds the tree using the information gain from top to bottom. The decision tree for classification has root nodes as a features and branch as numerical values (mean). For regression, however, the outputs of the tree are numbers. The building of the decision tree is a recursive process. </p>
<p>Another topic related to the decision tree is the decision boundary that can be used for separating a set of data. The decision boundary is the line that separates, and it can be linear or nonlinear. Every decision tree has its own decision boundary. The decision boundary for regression is shown through isophote. And the decision boundary for classification is determined by the numbers on the nodes. </p>

<center>July 13th, 2019</center>
Today, we discussed linear regression, neutral network, and k-means clustering. Linear regression models relationship between two quantitative variables. The variable x is the predictor and the variable y is the outcome or the dependent variable. For more than one predictors, we are dealing with vector. We use the loss function as a criteria to measure how good a prediction model does in linear regression. We want to minimize the mean squared error in our outcome variable and the predicted outcomes; in order to do that, we take the closed form(which is taking the derivative and set it equal to zero) of the loss function and define the best-fitting line. 

<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/4.jpg" alt="4.jpg"></p>
<p>We also mentioned cross validation: a way to best utilize training data and testing data for more accurate predictions. The method splits data into 5 sections. First, section 1 is used as testing data and section 2, 3, 4 and 5 are used as training data. Then, section 2 is used as testing data and the rest is used a training data. This process is repeated to all five sections for 5 tests. Finally, the average of 5 test results is taken. </p>
<p><img src="/2019/09/24/Project-Summary/5.png" alt="5.jpg"></p>
<p>Similar to linear regression, the neural network model is a set of algorithms. But unlike linear regression, which has limited expression and weak representation, neural network is multilayered and can be as complex as having millions of parameters. While the linear regression models has parameters, neural network has parameters as well as hidden layers of neutrons. To find all parameters in a neural network, the activation function is very important in introducing non-linear properties into the network. A neural network without the activation function is simply a linear regression model. Common activation functions are sigmoid and rectified linear unit. </p>
<p>Finally, we discussed k-means clustering, a method of identifying the number of centroids and assign each data point to the closest centroid as a cluster, while keeping the number of the centroids as low as possible. The algorithm first initialize the centroids through random selection and assign data points to the centroids. Then through an iterative process of checking data point assignment changes and updating centroids, the algorithms ends when there are no more changes made. </p>
